In this article we'll see how to create list and table sticky headers using only CSS.

Recently I needed to create a sticky header, so I searched for the best way to do it. I read many articles and posts, but it was not easy to find updated and clear information about this subject, mainly because recent updates to browsers compatibility make many articles outdated. So I'll share what I've learned with you, including some demos I've built to test the concepts.
